                <p> I'm a self-taught web developer aspiring to become a professional. Since             September 2017 I've committed to studying full time. I have so far been focussed     primarily on gaining a deep understanding of Javascript.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    A significan learning resource has been the content and online community of Watch and Code, as well as the mentorship of its founder Gordon Zhu. The course is meant to keep students on the edge of their comfort zone by disecting source code of apps and libraries, and using test-driven development to replicate methods built into Javascript.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    Other resources I have used include Free Code Camp, various courses on Udemy, and the Oden project, but source code and documentation have been the most valuable learning material. 
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    learning to code has provided a fascinating experience in unpacking concepts which demand an analytical approach and intense focus. I have become proficient in the essentials of front end development with HTML, SCSS, Javascript, and JQuery, and am indefinitely committed to the learning process.
